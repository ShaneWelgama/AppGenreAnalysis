# App Genre Analysis

In this project I am grabbing some Google Play and App Store datasets from Kaggle.com and will be exploring the data to find out which category of app appears to be the most popular and therefore the most profitable.

I got both datasets from Kaggle.com.

Data cleaning and analysis is done using python. This project helped my understanding in writing my own functions, for loops, if statements and nested loops.
